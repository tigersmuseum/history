# Historical data

## Introduction
These are web pages for the **history** repository at the [Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum](https://www.royalhampshireregiment.org/). The repository is somewhere for us share data that is relevant to military museums in general, as well as tips and techniques for organising and presenting data. The *View on GitHub* button, in the title bar above, takes you to repository itself. Below are links to examples, and if you're interested in how the examples work, some technical discussion. 

## Examples

- **[Regimental colours](https://tigersmuseum.github.io/history/colours/1stBn.svg)**, with honours on the colours linked to descriptions of the battles. This is an example of an *[image map](docs/imagemap.md)*.

- **[A map overlay](https://tigersmuseum.github.io/history/examples/51b.svg)** on a British trench map. This example shows map references mentioned in 11<sup>th</sup> Brigade Intelligence Summary reports between 25<sup>th</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup> of August, 1917. Locations in British territory are blue dots, and those in German territory are red dots. The position of the 11<sup>th</sup> Brigade front line during those dates is apparent. The example opens zoomed in on the overlaid data. Click anywhere to see the whole trench map.
