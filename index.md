# Historical data

## Introduction
These are web pages for the **history** repository at the [Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum](https://www.royalhampshireregiment.org/). The repository is somewhere for us to share data that is relevant to military museums in general, as well as tips and techniques for organising and presenting data.

Below are links to examples and further details. The *View on GitHub* button, in the title bar above, takes you to repository itself.

## Examples

- **[Regimental colours](https://tigersmuseum.github.io/history/colours/1stBn.svg)**, with honours on the colours linked to descriptions of the battles. This is an example of an [image map](docs/imagemap.md).

- **[A map overlay](https://tigersmuseum.github.io/history/examples/51b.svg)** on a British trench map. This shows map references mentioned in 11<sup>th</sup> Brigade Intelligence Summary reports between 25<sup>th</sup> and 29<sup>th</sup> of August, 1917. Locations in British territory are blue dots, and those in German territory are red dots. The position of the 11<sup>th</sup> Brigade front line during those dates is apparent. The example opens zoomed in on the overlaid data. Click anywhere to see the whole trench map. See the [technical description](docs/trench-map.md) for more on how this works.
