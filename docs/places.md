## Locations from Google Earth

[Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/).

* Click the *Projects* icon, select *Create a new Project*, then *Create KML file*. Give it a name and description.
* Search for places names. Click *Add to project* button at the bottom of the pop-up description pane for any that you want to keep.
* You can use the *Add placemark* icon at the bottom-left of the map to add any places that aren't in the search index.
* When you're happy, you can open the *Projects* pane and select *Export as KML file*.
* Later, you can pick up where you left off by using the *Import KML file from computer* option and adding new placemarks as above.

## Places

The [concept of place](https://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/document/obo-9780199874002/obo-9780199874002-0159.xml)

Sometimes a place is where you go because of what it is, irrespective of where it is. 

## Data

As KML. As OWL/RDF linked data.

The advantage of using Geonames and RDF is that you get a URI that uniquely identifies the place, and that can be used to get more information about the place. Placemarks from Google Earth have id attributes. It's not clear if these can sensibly be used outside of Google Earth.

Blank nodes?

A place is defined by its associations and context. We can use SKOS to organize places by context, e.g. billets.
