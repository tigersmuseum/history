<p class="note">This work derives from <em>Principle Events 1914-1918</em>, compiled by The Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence, and originally published by H.M. Stationery Office, in 1922; as part of the <em>History of the Great War</em>. It was prepared from the OCR text of the PDF copy held by the Internet Archive (<a href="https://archive.org/search?query=external-identifier%3A%22urn%3Aoclc%3Arecord%3A1050840522%22">urn:oclc:record:1050840522</a>).</p>
<p class="note">Only Part I of the book - the general chronological list - is reproduced in this work. Parts II and III give different presentations of entries in Part I. An ongoing effort will introduce semantic mark-up, with a view to being able to derive the presentation in Parts II and III (and more) from the chronological list.</p>
