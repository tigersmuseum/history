# First World War

- [A Concise Chronicle of Events of the Great War][1]
- 


This work derives from *Principle Events 1914-1918*, compiled by The Historical Committee of Imperial Defence, and originally published by H.M. Stationery Office, in 1922, as part of the *History of the Great War*. It was prepared from the OCR text of the PDF copy held by the Internet Archive ([urn:oclc:record:1050840522][2]).

Only Part I of the book, the general chronological list, is reproduced in this work. Parts II and III give different presentations of entries in Part I. An ongoing effort will introduce semantic mark-up, with a view to being able to derive the representation in Parts II and III (and more) from the chronological list.
