# Military Records

These are the public sources used to create a [Soldiers](https://github.com/tigersmuseum/soldiers) database for the Royal Hampshire Regiment museum. We want to be able to cite references to source material when researching former soldiers, and to make it easy to trace those references back to the original documents. The links below describe how we do this for each source.

## Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC)

You can download results from the [Find War Dead](https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/) tool as a CSV file. The **Id** field is CWGC's unique casualty identifier. Appending the casualty identifier to the URL:

  https://www.cwgc.org/find-records/find-war-dead/casualty-details/
  
creates a URL pointing to the results page for the specific category. We use this both as a web link in a HTML report, and as a URI to represent the CWGC record for the soldier.
